# py-csi-cobotics `gcc_tutorial` example build

`gcc_tutorial` shows a mobile robot base navigating around a cell while a human operator crosses its path. The simple robot controller aims to prevent collision. The setup is used as part of the py-csi-cobotics tutorial on setting up the framework for interacting with an instance of the twin.

For more information on assessing the safety of the case study, consider the [py-csi-cobotics `gcc_tutorial` tutorial](https://github.com/Gaudeval/py-csi-cobotics/tree/master/experiments/gcc_tutorial).
